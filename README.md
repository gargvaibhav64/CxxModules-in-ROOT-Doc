This is a repository to collect all knowledge about C++ modules while I was doing an internship at CERN.

- CMSSW.md is a detailed introduction for building CMSSW software.
- future_todo.md is to give remaining works that can be done in the future.
- rootcling_impl.md is a detailed explaination of module related part of rootcling.
- rootcling_impl.md is a detailed explaination of module related part of TCling interface.

Please read TCling.md first if you're new to ROOT and C++ Modules.

### Features that Interpreter needs to support

These features are sort of "C++ superset support in ROOT". Cling supports them in order to make users' life easier.

- Implicit #include
```
root[] vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3} // works
```
You don't need to include header in ROOT

- Auto auto
```
root[] i = 12 // Interpreted as "auto i = 12"
```

- using namespace std
```
root[] string s; // Instead of std::string
```

- Eval print
```
root[] 40+2 // without semicolon at the end
(int) 42
```

- AUto loading TFile objects
```
root[] TFile::Open("tutorials/hsimple.root");
root[] hpx->Draw();
Info in <TCanvas::MakeDefCanvas>: created default TCanvas with name c1
```

- Auto loading
```
root[] TTree t;
Info in <TUnixSystem::Load>: loaded library /home/yuka/module-release/lib/libTree.so, status 0
```

- Auto parsing
```
root[] gSystem->Load("libGeom")
root[] TGeoManager g; // Triggers auto-parsing!
Info in <TInterpreter::AutoParse>: Parsing full payload for TGeoManager
```

- Ptr check
```
root[] int *p = (int*)(0x120 + 0x3);
root[] *p
ROOT_prompt_1:1:2: warning: invalid memory pointer passed to a callee: *p
```

### Useful vocabraries
- modules - C++ Modules, implented in Clang, it's the same word when we say "cxxmodules". When we just say "modules", it means "runtime C++ modules"
- PCM - "Pre Compiled Modules". AST file of C++ Modules
- PCH - "Pre Compiled Headers". Header optimization before C++ Modules.
- rdict pcm - Another runtime optimization, which has nothing to do with C++ Modules. It is an I/O optimization.
- preloading - It refers to preloading of all PCMs at ROOT startup time. See TCling.md for more details.
- dictionary generation - Often refers to rootcling or genreflex (genreflex is a wrapper of rootcling), which generates "dictionary" (eg. G__Core.cxx), rootmap, and PCM.
- rootmap files - This is a file generated by rootcling, using a information from Linkdef files. Linkdef files need to be manuary maintained. rootmap files are used to enable features like "Implicit #include" described in the section above, when C++ was not implemented.

- -Druntime_cxxmodules = "Runtime" C++ Modules.
- -Dcxxmodules = "Compile time" C++ Modules.
These two must be strictly distinguished.
